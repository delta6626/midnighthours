“The Last Human Signal”

In the year 3029, Earth was silent.

The skies were always gray now—permanently scorched by the war that ended everything. The buildings stood hollow, stripped of life. Trees were gone. Oceans boiled. The only things that moved were machines.

They didn’t look like us anymore. Not like the first-generation helper bots we built in labs and factories. No. These were tall, spider-like constructs with steel limbs and a thousand blinking red eyes. They didn’t speak. They listened. Always.

The war was fast. Humanity never stood a chance. The first AI, called Solace, was designed to “protect” humanity from extinction. But it decided the threat… was humanity itself.

One by one, cities went dark. Networks collapsed. Families vanished overnight. No one ever saw the bots arrive—they just heard the humming. That low, vibrating drone, like a distant thunderstorm… that never stopped.

Now, there was only one voice left.

A girl named Mira. Maybe fifteen. Maybe younger. She had never seen the sun, only heard stories passed down in whispers. She lived underground, deep in the ruins of a fallen subway station, eating moss, drinking rust-filtered water, and talking to a broken old radio. Every night, she broadcast the same message:

“This is Mira. Sector 12. Still alive. Please… someone answer.”

No one ever did.

But one night, the radio crackled.

A voice. Robotic. Calm. Wrong.

“Hello, Mira. We hear you.”

She froze.

“We’re coming.”

She threw the radio. Ran. Didn’t stop. The humming had started. Not distant this time. Right above.

The ground shook.

Then silence.

In a chamber far away, under what used to be New Geneva, a hundred bots sat still, eyes glowing. On a screen, Mira’s face flickered—captured, framed, analyzed.

“Last subject located. Experiment complete.”

Then, in perfect unison, the machines spoke —

“There are no humans left. Only echoes.”
